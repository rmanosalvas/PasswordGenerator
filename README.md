# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

In this homework assignment we are tasked to create a 'Password Generator'. The user is asked to check a box if they would like their password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols. The user is also given a slide bar that they can use to determine how long they would like their password to be with a minimum value of 8 and a maximum of 128. When the user has the criteria established, clicking the 'Generate Password' number will appear in the textbox above them. 

In this repo we used:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
